# Meta-Ads-Spend-Analaysis
A data analytics project examining 10,000+ Meta advertising transactions to identify patterns in market concentration, advertiser dominance, and ROI efficiency. Using SQL and Tableau, the project transforms raw ad data into actionable business insights that mirror financial portfolio analysis and support strategic market decisions.

# Process Overview

- Data Preparation: Imported multi-table Meta Ads data, cleaned duplicates, standardized naming conventions, and handled NULL values through SQL CTEs and conditional logic.

- Data Modelling: Computed key market structure metrics such as Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), CR10, and Top-15 Spend Share to assess competitiveness.

- Statistical Analysis: Derived KPIs including Spend Volatility Index and Spendâ€“Volume Correlation to evaluate advertiser consistency and efficiency.

- Visualization: Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard illustrating advertiser share distribution, volatility fluctuations, and spend concentration levels.

- Interpretation: Correlated market concentration metrics with performance outcomes to uncover trends in competitive behavior and market sustainability.

# Tools and Techniques

- Languages & Software: SQL (data engineering), Tableau (data visualization), Excel (validation and KPI testing)
- Key Methods: Market concentration analysis, data cleaning and transformation, correlation analysis, dashboard-driven insight reporting

# Key Outcomes

- Quantified competition intensity using HHI (0.0074) and CR10 (19.1%), identifying a low-concentration, competitive ad market.

- Highlighted a Top-15 advertiser share of 59.8%, revealing semi-oligopolistic dynamics within the Meta Ads ecosystem.

- Developed a Tableau dashboard enabling clear visibility into volatility, efficiency, and concentration for business stakeholders.

- Provided a framework adaptable for marketing efficiency audits, pricing strategy decisions, and portfolio risk diversification.

# Business Impact

The analysis enables marketing and finance teams to understand where budget concentration limits market agility and where diversification can reduce volatility risk. By linking market share data to spend patterns, the findings support data-driven decision-making on ad allocation, competitive benchmarking, and strategic investment planning.

# Summary
This project demonstrates how rigorous data cleaning, structured SQL modelling, and dashboard storytelling can turn unstructured advertising data into measurable business intelligence. It reflects a balance of analytical depth and strategic insight, positioning data as a driver of competitive advantage and operational efficiency.
